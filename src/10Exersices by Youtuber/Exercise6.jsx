// What is the purpose of React.memo and how does it work?

// React.memo is a higher-order component that memoizes the result of a 
// component rendering. It helps to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary 
// re-renders when the props have not changed. It performs a shallow comparison of 
// the props to determine if a re-render is needed.
